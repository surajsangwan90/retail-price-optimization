## Project Description:
## Introduction to Price Optimization
Pricing a product is a crucial aspect of any business. A lot of thought process is put into it. There are different strategies to estimate prices for different kinds of products. There are products whose sales are pretty sensitive to their costs, and as such, a slight change in their price can lead to a noticeable difference in their sales. At the same time, there are also products whose sales are not much affected by their worth - these tend to be luxury items or necessities (like certain medicines). 
Price elasticity of demand (EPD), or elasticity, is the degree to which the compelling desire for something changes as its price changes. In general, people desire things less as those things become more expensive. However, for some products, the customers’ desire could drop sharply even with a bit of price increase, and for other products, it could stay almost the same even with a hefty price increase. Economists use the term elasticity to denote this sensitivity of sales to price fluctuations. More precisely, price elasticity gives the percentage change in quantity demanded when there is a one percent increase in price, holding everything else constant.

## Retail Price Optimization in Python
In this machine learning pricing optimization case study, we will take the data of a cafe and, based on their past sales, identify the optimal prices for their items based on the price elasticity of the items. The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted on Amazon RDS. First, We will calculate the price elasticity for each item, then figure out the optimal price. While taking a particular cafe data, one can extend this work to price any product. This machine learning retail price optimization project will focus on the former products.

## Dynamic Pricing Dataset
The data is contained in three CSV files.

Cafe -  **Sell MetaData.csv** This file has details about sales made by the cafe. 
Columns: Sell ID, Sell Category, Item ID, Item Name
Cafe - **Transaction -Store.csv** This file contains information about transactions and sale receipts of the cafe.
Columns: Calendar Date, Price, Quantity, Sell ID, Sell Category
Cafe - **DateInfo.csv** This has date information corresponding to the transactions performed.
Columns: Date, Year, Holiday, Weekend, School Break, Temperature, Outdoor
Also, We will fetch the data from Postgres database to python using psycopg2 library. 

**In detail, let us discuss all tools and techniques We will explore in this project.**

 

## Price Optimization Algorithms
Understanding customer behavior through sales data is crucial for the growth of any business. Not only it contributes to improved quality of products, but it additionally assists in determining the right price for the different products. For instance, products perceived as luxury items by the masses are sold at unreasonably high prices. In this dynamic pricing python project, We will use previous sales data to estimate the cost of different food items in a cafe. Additionally, We will have alook other price optimization methods like cost-less pricing, competition-based pricing, perceived value pricing, and demand-based pricing. This project will also introduce us to price elasticity, a concept that plays a critical role in determining price estimates.

 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Before the price optimization dataset is used for modeling, it must be processed. The dataset may contain redundancy that one must remove, and one must bring on all the variables of different data types on the same foot. In this project, We will work on the dataset of a burger cafe and use their three datasets related to sales, transactions, and corresponding dates. We will explore how to analyze the dataset using data visualization libraries of Python: matplotlib and seaborn. This price optimization machine learning project will also guide us on merging the datasets and preparing them to apply machine learning algorithms using Pandas dataframes.

 

##Machine Learning Algorithms
Instead of traditional statistical methods of price estimation, this project will perform price optimization using machine learning in Python. We will explore how to use the regression trees and ordinary least square method to estimate the price elasticity for different products. Furthermore, We will understand how statistical parameters like the r-squared value are interpreted for analysis. The project will also teach us how to improve the accuracy of the models by eliminating specific variable values. Additionally, We will explore maximizing profit using the results of price elasticities evaluation.

 

## Application of Machine Learning for Pricing Optimization in Python Project
Primarily, this project focuses on optimizing the prices of various items available in a burger cafe. The solution of this pricing optimization in Python project can be easily used by experts of different industries like medical, hospitality, insurance, etc. For example, an analyst can recommend changes to the prices of various services offered by a hotel depending on the previous residents’ feedback.
